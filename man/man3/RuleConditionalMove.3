.PP 
Simplify various conditional move situations\&. 

The simplest situation is when the code looks like 
.PP
.nf
if (boolcond)
  res0 = 1;
else
  res1 = 0;
res = ? res0 : res1

.fi
.PP
.PP
which gets simplified to \fCres = zext(boolcond)\fP The other major variation looks like 
.PP
.nf
if (boolcond)
   res0 = boolcond;
else
   res1 = differentcond;
res = ? res0 : res1

.fi
.PP
.PP
which gets simplified to \fCres = boolcond || differentcond\fP

.PP
Attempt to apply \fBthis\fP \fBRule\fP\&. This method contains the main logic for applying the \fBRule\fP\&. It must use a given \fBPcodeOp\fP as the point at which the \fBRule\fP applies\&. If it does apply, changes are made directly to the function and 1 (non-zero) is returned, otherwise 0 is returned\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIop\fP is the given \fBPcodeOp\fP where the \fBRule\fP may apply 
.br
\fIdata\fP is the function to which to apply

.SS "virtual \fBRule\fP* RuleConditionalMove::clone (const \fBActionGroupList\fP & grouplist) const\fC [inline]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Clone the \fBRule\fP\&. If \fBthis\fP \fBRule\fP is a member of one of the groups in the grouplist, this returns a clone of the \fBRule\fP, otherwise NULL is returned\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIgrouplist\fP is the list of groups being cloned 
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the cloned \fBRule\fP or NULL

.PP
List of op codes this rule operates on\&. Populate the given array with all possible OpCodes this \fBRule\fP might apply to\&. By default, this method returns all possible OpCodes 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIoplist\fP is the array to populate
