.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Attempt to normalize symmetric block structures\&. 

This is used in conjunction with the action \fBActionBlockStructure\fP to make the most natural choice, when there is a choice in how code is structured\&. This uses the preferComplement() method on structured FlowBlocks to choose between symmetric structurings, such as an if/else where the \fBtrue\fP and \fBfalse\fP blocks can be swapped\&.

.PP
Make a single attempt to apply \fBthis\fP \fBAction\fP\&. This is the main entry point for applying changes to a function that are specific to \fBthis\fP \fBAction\fP\&. The method can inspect whatever it wants to decide if the \fBAction\fP does or does not apply\&. Changes are indicated by incrementing the \fBcount\fP field\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIdata\fP is the function to inspect/modify

\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
0 for a complete application, -1 for a partial completion (due to breakpoint)

.SS "virtual \fBAction\fP* ActionPreferComplement::clone (const \fBActionGroupList\fP & grouplist) const\fC [inline]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Clone the \fBAction\fP\&. If \fBthis\fP \fBAction\fP is a member of one of the groups in the grouplist, this returns a clone of the \fBAction\fP, otherwise NULL is returned\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIgrouplist\fP is the list of groups being cloned 
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
