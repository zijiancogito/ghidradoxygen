.PP 
A kind of \fBMemoryBank\fP which retrieves its data from an underlying \fBLoadImage\fP\&. 

Any bytes requested on the bank which lie in the \fBLoadImage\fP are retrieved from the \fBLoadImage\fP\&. Other addresses in the space are filled in with zero\&. This bank cannot be written to\&.

.PP
\fBConstructor\fP for a loadimage memorybank\&. A \fBMemoryImage\fP needs everything a basic memory bank needs and is needs to know the underlying \fBLoadImage\fP object to forward read reqests to\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIspc\fP is the address space associated with the memory bank 
.br
\fIws\fP is the number of bytes in the preferred wordsize (must be power of 2) 
.br
\fIps\fP is the number of bytes in a page (must be power of 2) 
.br
\fIld\fP is the underlying \fBLoadImage\fP

.PP
Overridden find method\&. Find an aligned word from the bank\&. First an attempt is made to fetch the data from the \fBLoadImage\fP\&. If this fails, the value is returned as 0\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIaddr\fP is the address of the word to fetch

.PP
Overridded getPage method\&. Retrieve an aligned page from the bank\&. First an attempt is made to retrieve the page from the \fBLoadImage\fP, which may do its own zero filling\&. If the attempt fails, the page is entirely filled in with zeros\&.
