.PP 
Define formal link between stack-pointer values before and after sub-function calls\&. 

Change to the stack-pointer across a sub-function is called \fBextrapop\fP\&. This class makes sure there is p-code relationship between the \fBVarnode\fP coming into a sub-function and the \fBVarnode\fP coming out\&. If the \fIextrapop\fP is known, the p-code will be a CPUI_COPY or CPUI_ADD\&. If it is unknown, a CPUI_INDIRECT will be inserted that gets filled in by \fBActionStackPtrFlow\fP\&.

.PP
Make a single attempt to apply \fBthis\fP \fBAction\fP\&. This is the main entry point for applying changes to a function that are specific to \fBthis\fP \fBAction\fP\&. The method can inspect whatever it wants to decide if the \fBAction\fP does or does not apply\&. Changes are indicated by incrementing the \fBcount\fP field\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP

\fIdata\fP is the function to inspect/modify

0 for a complete application, -1 for a partial completion (due to breakpoint)

.PP
Clone the \fBAction\fP\&. If \fBthis\fP \fBAction\fP is a member of one of the groups in the grouplist, this returns a clone of the \fBAction\fP, otherwise NULL is returned\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP

\fIgrouplist\fP is the list of groups being cloned
