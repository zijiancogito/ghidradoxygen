.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A pool of Rules that apply simultaneously\&. 

This class groups together a set of Rules as a formal \fBAction\fP\&. Rules are given an opportunity to apply to every \fBPcodeOp\fP in a function\&. Usually rule_repeatapply is enabled for this action, which causes all Rules to apply repeatedly until no \fBRule\fP can make an additional change\&.

.SS "void ActionPool::addRule (\fBRule\fP * rl)"

.PP
Add a \fBRule\fP to the pool\&. This method should only be invoked during construction of this \fBActionPool\fP A single \fBRule\fP is added to the pool\&. The \fBRule\fP's OpCode is inspected by this method\&.

.SS "int4 ActionPool::apply (\fBFuncdata\fP & data)\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Make a single attempt to apply \fBthis\fP \fBAction\fP\&. This is the main entry point for applying changes to a function that are specific to \fBthis\fP \fBAction\fP\&. The method can inspect whatever it wants to decide if the \fBAction\fP does or does not apply\&. Changes are indicated by incrementing the \fBcount\fP field\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIdata\fP is the function to inspect/modify

.SS "\fBAction\fP * ActionPool::clone (const \fBActionGroupList\fP & grouplist) const\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Clone the \fBAction\fP\&. If \fBthis\fP \fBAction\fP is a member of one of the groups in the grouplist, this returns a clone of the \fBAction\fP, otherwise NULL is returned\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
