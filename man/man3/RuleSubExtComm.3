Commute SUBPIECE and INT_ZEXT: \fCsub(zext(V),c) => zext(sub(V,c))\fP 

This is in keeping with the philosophy to push SUBPIECE back earlier in the expression\&. The original SUBPIECE is changed into the INT_ZEXT, but the original INT_ZEXT is not changed, a new SUBPIECE is created\&. This rule also works with INT_SEXT\&.

.PP
Attempt to apply \fBthis\fP \fBRule\fP\&. This method contains the main logic for applying the \fBRule\fP\&. It must use a given \fBPcodeOp\fP as the point at which the \fBRule\fP applies\&. If it does apply, changes are made directly to the function and 1 (non-zero) is returned, otherwise 0 is returned\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIop\fP is the given \fBPcodeOp\fP where the \fBRule\fP may apply 
.br
\fIdata\fP is the function to which to apply

.PP
Clone the \fBRule\fP\&. If \fBthis\fP \fBRule\fP is a member of one of the groups in the grouplist, this returns a clone of the \fBRule\fP, otherwise NULL is returned\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIgrouplist\fP is the list of groups being cloned
