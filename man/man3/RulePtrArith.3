Transform pointer arithmetic\&. 

\fBRule\fP for converting integer arithmetic to pointer arithmetic\&. A string of INT_ADDs is converted into PTRADDs and PTRSUBs\&.
.PP
Basic algorithm: Starting with a varnode of known pointer type (with known size):
.IP "\(bu" 2
Generate list of terms added to pointer
.IP "\(bu" 2
Find all terms that are multiples of pointer size
.IP "\(bu" 2
Find all terms that are smaller than pointer size
.IP "\(bu" 2
Find sum of constants smaller than pointer size
.IP "\(bu" 2
Multiples get converted to PTRADD
.IP "\(bu" 2
Constant gets converted to nearest subfield offset
.IP "\(bu" 2
Everything else is just added back on
.PP
.PP
We need to be wary of most things being in the units of the space being pointed at\&. Type calculations are always in bytes so we need to convert between space units and bytes\&.

.PP
Attempt to apply \fBthis\fP \fBRule\fP\&. This method contains the main logic for applying the \fBRule\fP\&. It must use a given \fBPcodeOp\fP as the point at which the \fBRule\fP applies\&. If it does apply, changes are made directly to the function and 1 (non-zero) is returned, otherwise 0 is returned\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIop\fP is the given \fBPcodeOp\fP where the \fBRule\fP may apply 
.br
\fIdata\fP is the function to which to apply

.PP
Clone the \fBRule\fP\&. If \fBthis\fP \fBRule\fP is a member of one of the groups in the grouplist, this returns a clone of the \fBRule\fP, otherwise NULL is returned\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIgrouplist\fP is the list of groups being cloned
