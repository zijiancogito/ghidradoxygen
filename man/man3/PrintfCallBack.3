.PP
Call back method for address based breakpoints\&. This routine is invoked during emulation, if this breakpoint has somehow been associated with this address\&. The callback can perform any operation on the emulator context it wants\&. It then returns \fBtrue\fP if these actions are intended to replace the action of the \fBentire\fP machine instruction at this address\&. Or it returns \fBfalse\fP if the machine instruction should still be executed normally\&.
